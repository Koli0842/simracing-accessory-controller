I designed a 3D printed very minimal handbrake to serve as an entry point one can make with a 3D Printer and basic soldering skills easily. It has a small footprint, a desk clamp, and a hall effect sensor. I have a mostly stock Ender 3. It totals at about ~100g filament.

### Printing

I generally print with 3 perimeters, 4 bottom, 3 top, 18% gyroid infill

#### Settings and parts info:

##### Desk Clamp Body
- Printed on the slanted side to avoid layer separation as the weakest point
- 42% gyroid infill
- Used 35g PLA

##### Desk Clamp Shelf
- Printed on narrow side to avoid layer separation as the weakest point
- Used 4.3g PLA

##### Desk Clamp Tightener
- Printed with cut in half & hot glued together
- 0 bottom perimeter to allow gluing
- 18% gyroid infill
- Used 12g PLA

##### Handbrake Body
- Defaults, hopefully layer separation won't be an issue on this piece
- Used 12g PLA

##### Handbrake Actuator
- Defaults
- Used 11g PLA

##### Handbrake Grip
- auto support under 30°
- 13% gyroid infill
- Used 29g PLA

##### Arduino Cage
- Defaults
- Used 2g PLA
