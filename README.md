# Simracing Accessory Controller

This project is started off as a homemade analog handbrake made from spare parts of a 20 years old plastic steering wheel pedals.

The project is extremely simple based on the Library https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary, I use an Arduino Pro Micro in my instance.

Since my G29 Shifter is acting up, requiring a re-plug it to the wheel base each powerup, which is very inconvinient with a hard-mount, so I am considering incorporating code from https://github.com/JRomainG/Driving-Force-Shifter-USB-Adapter to have it all in one place.

Once I get to upgrade my rig, I will probably populate the rest of my IO pins with extra buttons and switches on a button board, complete with 3D printed parts.

I might add stl-s for 3d printing a really cheap analogue handbrake version too, my current one is partially made of metal.
